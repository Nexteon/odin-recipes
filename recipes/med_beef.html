  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lemon</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 cups cooked long-grain rice (cold leftovers are best)</li>
      <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 pt. grape or cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>1/2 seedless cucumber, cut into 1/4" pieces</li>
      <li>2 Scallions, Sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh mint, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>Crumbled feta cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Finely grate the zest of the lemon, then cut the lemon in half. 
          Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. 
          Add the beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned, 4 to 5 
          minutes (spoon off and discard any excess fat). Add the garlic and 1⁄4 
          teaspoon each salt and pepper and cook, stirring, for 1 minute; toss with 
          the lemon zest. Transfer the beef to a bowl and squeeze the juice of half a lemon on top.</li>
      <li>Wash and dry the skillet, then heat the remaining tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. 
        Add the rice and season with the cumin, coriander, and 1⁄4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. 
        Cook, tossing occasionally, until the rice begins to crisp at the edges, about 5 minutes. 
        Fold in the beef mixture and remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, squeeze the juice of the remaining lemon half into a medium bowl. 
        Toss with the tomatoes, cucumber, scallions, and 1⁄4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. 
        Fold in the mint and serve over the rice. Top with crumbled feta, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
