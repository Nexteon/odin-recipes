  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>In honor of everyone’s favorite made-up holiday, I’ve simplified my already very simple chocolate mousse recipe. 
    Besides being super easy to do, this ended up being the most delicious, perfectly textured chocolate mousse I’ve ever enjoyed. 
    I was thrilled with that part of this exercise, but I was left slightly annoyed knowing that I’ve been making chocolate mousse 
    all these years with a completely unnecessary step in the recipe.
    One of the keys to this streamlined method is having access to a metal mixing bowl you can place directly over the heat.
    If you don’t, you can use a saucepan—but it’s much harder to get the whisk into the corners of the pan. The other keys tips 
    are use really nice chocolate (duh), and do not over-whip the cream. Whether you’re a beginner making this for the first time, 
    or an expert looking to save a step, I think this is the perfect chocolate mousse, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>7  ounces dark chocolate (62% cacao is ideal)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tiny pinches salt</li>
      <li>1 cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Break up or chop chocolate into small pieces and set aside with butter.</li>
      <li>Add egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt to a metal mixing bowl. Cook, whisking, directly over 
        medium-low heat until the mixture is thick, foamy, and hot to the 
        touch (145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C)). </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Chef's Note:
      This mixture can also be cooked in a saucepan, but make sure the whisk is getting into the corners of the pan so egg doesn’t stick.</p>

    <ol start="3">
      <li>Once the yolk mixture is thick and hot, add chocolate and butter, and whisk until all 
        chocolate is melted. Let rest for a few minutes on the counter, whisking occasionally to 
        further cool the mixture to just above or at room temperature. The chocolate mixture shouldn’t 
        go into the whipped cream while still warm, but if cooled too long, the mixture may get too firm to fold in.</li>
      <li>Whisk cold cream until medium stiff peaks form. If cream is whisked further, it will separate and the final texture will be grainy.</li>
      <li>Transfer about 1/3 of chocolate mixture into whipped cream, and fold with a spatula until almost incorporated. 
        Gently fold in remaining chocolate, trying to keep as much air in the mixture as possible.</li>
      <li>Transfer into 4 serving dishes, wrap, and chill before serving, at least 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Chef's Note
      You can use 1/4 cup water as specified, or you can use another liquid for part of the water, such as a combination of 2 tablespoons water + 
      2 tablespoons cold coffee, or 3 tablespoons water + 1 tablespoon rum, if you would like a flavor other than pure chocolate for your mousse.</p>
